## Platform Specifc Installation Guide

To execute VIEWS pipeline code, carefully review this section and ensure that you meet all technical requirements.

**1. Requirements**

**Step 1:** The VIEWS pipeline does not run on Windows machines, therefore, a Linux machine or Mac is required. 

**Step 2:** Always, always be connected to the VPN, even when in the office. 

**Step 3:** If you are on Mac, you will need the development tools (xcode-select –install). If you are on Linux, you will need the build subsistem (e.g. build-essential in Debian and Ubuntu). You can test if you have these by opening a terminal and typing gcc.

**Step 4:** Make sure zsh is installed. You can test if you have zsh by opening a terminal and typing zsh. To install it on Linux type `sudo apt install zsh` in Ubuntu.

**Step 5:** You need a set of certificates allowing direct Postgres access, which are generated by either Mihai or Jim. Once you have the certificates, create .postgres and .postgresql folders in your home directory and place them in both.

As a last point, consider that the training of some models might require a GPU. However, even in the case of the sklearn based models that don't require a GPU, still need sufficient RAM, especially on the pgm level. 


**2. Set up the Environment**

**Step 1:** Start by creating a conda environment (Python verson 3.11) and activate it. Git clone the [views-pipeline-core](https://github.com/views-platform/views-pipeline-core) repo and the other VIEWS pipeline components. 

**Step 2:** Run  the following commands to make sure the viewser configs are set properly:
`viewser config set REMOTE_URL https://viewser.viewsforecasting.org`
`viewser config set AZURE_BLOB_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME viewsblobs`
`viewser config set AZURE_BLOB_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY ilP95+ci1mRVqFnqoKBRWzN8W99KWshw3YV9gup4MskVf4KiDZeFtcwtX9e5Ej0vsSF8DXOF+DBosTj8wgjwg==`
`viewser config set MODEL_METADATA_DATABASE_HOSTNAME gjoll.muspelheim.local`

**Step 3:** Navigate to [views-models](https://github.com/views-platform/views-models) and select the model/ensemble you want to run. Make sure you have the rights to run the `run.sh` file in the respective model/ensemble directory: `chmod +x run.sh`

**Step 4:**  Run the `run.sh` file  using appropriate flags. See the [views-models README](https://github.com/views-platform/views-models/README.md) detailed information on which flags to use and for further use cases e.g. how to build a new model. 

In the case of error messages, please check again if you are connected to the VPN. 

## Design Objectives

The development of the VIEWS pipeline is driven by several core objectives. 

- **Modularity** – The pipeline is divided into distinct modules, each with a specific task. This makes the codebase more maintainable and extensible.  
- **Reusability** – By separating concerns into different directories and scripts, components can be reused across multiple projects or pipeline stages.  
- **Scalability** – The modular design enables easy scaling. New features or components can be added while maintaining existing functionality.  
- **Maintainability** – The codebase is easier to understand and maintain when concerns are clearly separated and components have well-defined interfaces.  
- **Experiment Tracking** – By integrating with Weights and Biases, experiments are tracked and logged, making them more reproducible and easier to analyze.  
- **Testing** – Automated tests ensure the pipeline's accuracy and reliability over time, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.

## views-pipeline-core Contents:
## CLI

The `cli/utils.py` file automates command-line argument parsing and validation. It ensures that the user enters valid and compatible arguments when running various commands in the pipeline. This helps to prevent errors and ensures that the pipeline performs as expected.


### Key Functions


1. **Argument Validation:** These checks ensure that the user does not provide incompatible or missing arguments when interacting with the pipeline that could cause errors during execution. This also allows for more intuitive and straightforward pipeline execution.
2. **Error Handling** – Provides error messages and instructions to assist users in providing correct arguments. Attempting to use the --ensemble flag with the --sweep flag results in an error message and program exit. Instructions following the error message ensure that users can navigate through the pipeline in a simple and easily understandable manner.
3. **Guidance for Correct Usage** – Error messages provide suggestions for resolving the issue. In addition to the detailed error messages, the offered suggestions help users understand how to use the command-line interface correctly and ensures that the pipeline runs smoothly.

## Configs

### Drift Detection

Relying on large amounts of data for our forecasts, it is crucial to monitor any possible anomalies which may occur in the input data for our models, also known as **data drift**. Data drift is defined as changes in the statistical properties of data that occur over time and can have an impact on machine learning model performance. Thus, detecting and addressing data drift is critical to maintaining model accuracy and reliability. In the VIEWS pipeline, the `drift_detection.py` file includes a dictionary (drift_detection_partition_dict) that sets thresholds and parameters for detecting data drift.


### Logging

As a logging system plays a central role in monitoring and efficiency in the execution of the VIEWS pipeline, we have carefully considered all aspects, such as what elements are logged, where these logs are stored or the amount of detail the logs entail. These specific aspects can be easily configured by changing the `logging.yaml` file which directly configures the pipeline's logging system.

### Pipeline

The overall setting and properties of the pipeline are centralized in the `PipelineConfig` class, which can be found in the `pipeline.py` file.  This class contains methods for accessing and modifying global settings, which ensures consistency and ease of maintenance.

## Dataloaders

To be able to handle and manage all the input data, the VIEWS pipeline relies on the `ViewsDataLoader` class. This class contains methods and functionality for managing the data operations in the pipeline. This includes retrieving data, validating data partitions, managing drift detection settings, and ensuring data consistency. The `ViewsDataLoader` class can be found in the `dataloaders.py` file. As its main focus is on the core component of data, it is necesary for the `ViewsDataLoader` to be able to seamlessly interact with other pipeline components. 

### How Dataloaders Fit Into The Pipeline


1. **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing** – The `ViewsDataLoader` class collects and loads data from [viewser](https://github.com/prio-data/viewser) as a [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html). By providing methods for validating data partitions and handling drift detection configurations, the `ViewsDataLoader` class ensures data consistency and quality.
2. **Integration** – The `ViewsDataLoader` class works with other pipeline components, including [`ModelPathManager`](#modelpathmanager) in order to manage model paths, as well as drift detection through configurations for monitoring data drift. This integration ensures that data operations are connected to other pipeline components, such as model training and evaluation, allowing for smooth execution.  
3. **Logging and Debugging** – The class additionally utilizes logging to track data operations and gain insight into the loading process. This is useful for debugging and tracking the pipeline's performance.
4. **Maintaining Consistency and Quality** – The `ViewsDataLoader` class ensures accurate data loading, validation, and processing. As such, it is crucial for ensuring and increasing the model reliability and validity.

## Utils for Weights & Biases

Being able to track model performance is of utmost priority in the VIEWS pipeline. For this reason, the VIEWS pipeline is integrated with the [Weights&Biases(W&B)](https://wandb.ai/site/) platform. This allows us to track the evaluation metrics of all models and ensembles. The `utils.py` file contains utility functions for monitoring all evaluation metrics on W&B. The available functions assist in organizing and updating log dictionaries with evaluation metrics, which are critical for tracking and understanding model performance over time and across datasets.


### How Utils Fit Into The Pipeline

### Key Functions

1. **Experiment Tracking** – The utility functions located in the `utils.py` file are essential for integration with W&B, which tracks experimental models and processes in the pipeline. By logging evaluation metrics in W&B, the pipeline allows for monitoring model performance across multiple experiments, in turn simplifying comparisons between results and identifying the top-performing models or ensembles.
2. **Model Evaluation** – These functions organize and update log dictionaries with all of the evaluation metrics. By recording and organizing all of the logs, we ensure that the evaluation metrics are recorded in a structured manner, making the interpretation and analysis of the results easier, as well as more straightforward.
3. **Performance Monitoring** - In addition to offering logging model performance metrics, the VIEWS pipeline also generates log dictionaries for both month- and time-series-wise evaluation metrics to allow for tracking model performance over time and across
datasets. This directly aids in identifying trends, patterns, and potential issues with the models, allowing for timely and effective interventions and improvements.
4. **Integration with Other Components** – Utility functions in `utils.py` cn also be utilized by different pipeline components, such as model managers and evaluation scripts, in order to log evaluation metrics in W&B. Including this integration ensures that evaluation metrics are consistently logged and tracked across the pipeline.
